Description: Provides functions for analyzing the association between
    one single response categorical variable (SRCV) and one multiple response
    categorical variable (MRCV), or between two or three MRCVs.  A modified Pearson
    chi-square statistic can be used to test for marginal independence for the one or
    two MRCV case, or a more general loglinear modeling approach can be used to examine
    various other structures of association for the two or three MRCV case.  Bootstrap-
    and asymptotic-based standardized residuals and model-predicted odds ratios are
    available, in addition to other descriptive information. Statisical methods implemented 
    are described in Bilder et al. (2000) <doi:10.1080/03610910008813665>,
    Bilder and Loughin (2004) <doi:10.1111/j.0006-341X.2004.00147.x>,
