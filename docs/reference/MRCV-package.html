Notation: For the two or three MRCV case, define row variable,
W, column variable, Y, and strata variable, Z, as MRCVs with binary items
(i.e., categories) Wi for i = 1, ..., I, Yj for j = 1, ..., J, and Zk
for k = 1, ..., K, respectively.  Define a marginal count as the number
of subjects who responded (Wi = a, Yj = b, Zk = c) for a, b, and c belonging
to the set {0, 1}.  For the one MRCV case, let W be an SRCV such that I = 1
and 'a' corresponds to one of r levels of W, and let Y be the MRCV as
previously defined.
Format of Data Frame: Many of the functions require a data frame
containing the raw data structured such that the n rows correspond to
the individual item response vectors, and the columns correspond to the
items, W1, ..., WI, Y1, ..., YJ, and Z1, ..., ZK (in this order).
Some of the functions use a summary version of the raw data frame (converted
automatically without need for user action) formatted to have rx2J rows and
4 columns generically named W, Y, yj, and count
(one MRCV case), 2Ix2J rows and 5 columns named W, Y,
wi, yj, and count (two MRCV case), or 2Ix2Jx2K rows and
7 columns named W, Y, Z, wi, yj,
zk, and count (three MRCV case). The column named count
contains the marginal counts defined above.
Descriptive Functions: Users can call the
item.response.table function to obtain a cross-tabulation of
the positive and negative responses for each combination of items, or the
marginal.table function to obtain a cross-tabulation of only
the positive responses.
Functions to Test for Marginal Independence: Methods proposed by
Agresti and Liu (1999), Bilder and Loughin (2004), Bilder, Loughin, and
Nettleton (2000), and Thomas and Decady (2004) are implemented using the
MI.test function.  This function calculates a modified Pearson
chi-square statistic that can be used to test for multiple marginal
independence (MMI; one MRCV case) or simultaneous pairwise marginal
independence (SPMI; two MRCV case).  MMI is a test of whether the SRCV, W,
is marginally independent of each Yj, where the modified statistic is the
sum of the J Pearson statistics used to test for independence of each (W,
Yj) pair.  SPMI is a test of whether each Wi is pairwise independent of each
Yj, where the modified statistic is the sum of the IxJ Pearson statistics
used to test for independence of each (Wi, Yj) pair.  The asymptotic
distribution of the modified statistics is a linear combination of
independent chi-square(1) random variables, so traditional methods for
analyzing the association between categorical variables W and Y are
inappropriate.  The MI.test function offers three sets of
testing methods: a nonparametric bootstrap approach, a Rao-Scott
second-order adjustment, and a Bonferroni adjustment, that can be used in
conjunction with the modified statistic to construct an appropriate test for
independence.
Functions for Performing Regression Modeling: Regression
modeling methods described by Bilder and Loughin (2007) are implemented
using genloglin and methods summary.genloglin,
residuals.genloglin, anova.genloglin, and
predict.genloglin.  The genloglin function
provides parameter estimates and Rao-Scott adjusted standard errors for
models involving two or three MRCVs.  The anova.genloglin
function offers second-order Rao-Scott and bootstrap adjusted model
comparison and goodness-of-fit (Pearson and LRT) statistics.  The
residuals.genloglin and predict.genloglin
functions provide bootstrap- and asymptotic-based standardized Pearson
residuals and model-based odds ratios, respectively.
General Notes: Rao-Scott adjustments may not be feasible when
the total number of MRCV items is large.  In this case, an error message
will be returned describing a memory allocation issue."><meta property="og:description" content="Provides functions for analyzing the association between one single response
